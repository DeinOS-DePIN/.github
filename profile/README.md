# DeinOS Open Collective

Welcome to **DeinOS** — a Decentralized Physical Infrastructure project redefining cloud DevOps and championing the broader movement for cloud decentralization. DeinOS is a collaborative initiative dedicated to building and supporting open-source solutions for modern, distributed operations and systems management.

## Mission
Our mission is to decentralize the cloud by developing and sustaining a robust ecosystem for physical and virtual infrastructure. DeinOS empowers communities and organizations to achieve greater autonomy, scalability, and transparency in managing their operations and systems.

## Why DeinOS?
DeinOS stands for **Your Operations and Systems** ("Dein" means "Your" in German), highlighting the collective’s focus on empowerment and ownership. Our vision includes:
